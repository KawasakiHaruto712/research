is there a reason to set this to 'non-True' as opposed to 'False'. I would think the later is what a customer would set it to.

This is remotable, which means it really shouldn't be scanning across cells. Remotable methods are only really used by db-isolated services, which means compute and the like, which can't talk to other cells anyway.

This is why we have a dedicated method for this in service:

Here, we could decide whether to scatter-gather based on whether the context is already targeted to a cell? If it is, don't scatter-gather, else do.
As discussed on IRC, we could be more efficient here if we know we're going to restrict ourselves to same-cell for move operations by not querying all cells in that case.

Each of the move methods in conductor/manager is decorated with @targets_cell which targets the context before passing it along. So that means in this method we could have an already-cell-targeted context.

We could decide whether or not to scatter-gather based on whether request_spec.requested_destination.cell is set. (And make sure we move all setup_instance_group calls *after* requested_destination.cell are set in conductor tasks.
We could have another condition here which checks:

 if 'requested_destination' in request_spec and
     request_spec.requested_destination.cell:

and do instead of scatter-gather:

 with request_spec.instance_group.obj_alternate_context(context):
     request_spec.instance_group.get_hosts()

and I think we would need to use obj_alternate_context because when the RequestSpec is queried in compute/api at the beginning of a move operation, the context isn't targeted yet, so the request_spec.instance_group object will also not have a _context targeted to a cell.

So, I think the bug I'm trying to fix affects move operations as well as instance creates.",0

nit: we might want to consider adding a method on RequestContext to hide the internals of what a targeted contxt means, which would just be this, but we could add something like:

def is_targeted():
    return context.db_connection is not None
Why do we need to clone the object?
OK thinking out loud, if I'm creating a new instance, we get here from schedule_and_build_instances in conductor before we get to the scheduler. This is going to iterate all cells looking for hosts that members of the group are already in.

If I'm creating a server in an anti-affinity group, then we need to iterate all cells to find all hosts that those instances are in since my new instance can't land on one of those hosts, and it should be possible to have members of an anti-affinity group in different cells.

If I'm creating a server in an affinity group, then we're still iterating all cells looking for hosts on which the group members live, but because it's an affinity policy, the members should be in the same cell (although soft-affinity policy messes this up because we could technically put instances in the same group on different hosts in different cells). So just considering the strict affinity case, if the group has at least one member in it, we should know exactly which cell the new instance needs to go in, and we don't need to iterate all cells - but maybe that's a performance optimization for later? Also note that we could be racing if we have multiple server create requests for the same affinity group and the scheduler decides to put them each in different cells - the late affinity check in the compute won't resolve that because the upcall check is targeted to the cell the compute is in, and won't see any other hosts for other members in other cells. Separate bug though...
I kind of wish we were using a functional test for all of this, because it's pretty complicated with multiple cells and multiple services (API, conductor, scheduler), and could be easy to mock something out that isn't realistic.",1

-1 is for the things in the test.
nit: policies=['anti-affinity'] since that's the only policy that makes sense here since inst1 and inst3 are in different cells.
This doesn't really make sense because inst2 and inst4 are in different cells, which would violate a strict affinity policy because if they are in different cells they are obviously on different hosts. The only way this can happen is if you created inst2 and inst4 concurrently and the scheduler put them in different cells (as noted in the other part of this change).
Why would these hosts be in here? These are for the instances in groupA.
This doesn't make sense - if we're moving inst1 and that is in cell1, we shouldn't ever be targeting cell2 here.
Again, instance2 is in cell1 so we shouldn't ever be targeting cell2 for a move operation on instance2.",1

Presumably it's because we are doing this in parallel and can't target the object in multiple threads at the same time.",0

Okay, let me try to re-approach the testing with a functional test with a real world scenario.
Yeah, good point.
I think what I was thinking here is that the obj_alternate_context is going to mutate the cell_instance_group._context and to do this in a scatter-gather, we need those to be separate object copies. Am I mistaken about it?
Ack.
Yeah, I think this goes back to what I mentioned on IRC about how I kept thinking ""multiple cases of affinity per cell"" which is not really a thing. Will fix.
They were added by the first call on L488 where the scenario is, boot an instance with groupA and no policy. Then setup_instance_group is called a second time with an instance in groupB to force a lookup of groupB's hosts.

I need to rework this test to make sense in the real world, I think. I was only focused on covering the code paths.",0

A suggestion and a question inline.
This means that while a cell is temporary down we can break the affinity rule. I think we know the members of the group here and we have InstanceMapping so we can figure out if there are members of this group in the down cell. If this is a group with affinity policy and there are members of the group in a cell that is down then we can fail this boot with NoValidHost to keep the affinity policy.
I'm totally OK to fix this in a separate patch later, but I suggest to put a TODO in the code.
Shouldn't we need to fail the boot in this case? I feel we silently ignoring a potential error case here.",1

Note that you could also check self._context and explode if it's untargeted. Presumably lazy-loading without a targeted cell is never going to yield the right thing (probably true for any object in the cell db).",1

A question inline about redundancy in _get_group_details.
Seen here:

http://logs.openstack.org/58/540258/13/check/neutron-tempest-multinode-full/d533c9d/logs/screen-n-super-cond.txt.gz#_Aug_16_07_54_28_752780

That is during a server create request.

I don't see the same log message in the cell conductor logs during a move...which is kind of surprising.

(later)

OK I see that with your change we don't rely on the lazy-load if we're moving and hosts isn't set:

# NOTE(melwitt): Proactively query for the instance group hosts instead of
# relying on a lazy-load via the 'hosts' field of the InstanceGroup object.
So here we turn around and load up the group and if group.hosts is called, it will lazy-load using the given context, which for a new server create is untargeted, but for a move is targeted to the cell we're moving within.
Isn't this all totally redundant? Like, couldn't we just avoid all of this is user_group_hosts is not None?
I can't remember why you needed to clone this. Since I've had to ask multiple times now it'd probably be good to leave a comment.
Christ this comment is old.
Couldn't this just be:

group.hosts

To trigger the lazy-load with the targeted context? It would admittedly look weird.
So we get this set above by reference right?",1

I assume this is part of your other comment, before you saw the proactively query to avoid a lazy-load?
Maybe? What I was trying to do here is keep the behavior we already have, that is, replace the old set(group.get_hosts()) with the scatter-gather if not targeted. Are you suggesting a change in behavior with this patch or am I missing something?
Sure, I can add a comment here.
I guess so? I guess I'd want it to be whatever reads best to code readers. If you think a plain ""group.hosts"" conveys the meaning better (force a lazy-load), then I can change it.
Yes, should be. I set group = request_spec.instance_group and loaded 'hosts' to 'group' to make code lines shorter, but refer to the same thing. These shouldn't be just 'group' because 'group' is only added as a reference if the hosts aren't yet loaded.",0
"Patch Set 13:

(3 comments)

Add the comment and I'll +W.
Yeah.
I would be OK with doing what you have here for backward compat since we'll want to backport this change, and then work on dropping this old suspiciously redundant code in Stein so we don't risk a regression in stable.
No group.hosts is clearly not more obvious, and would require a comment. I've seen it in tests for other objects which is what made me think of it, but I always have to remember about lazy-loading setting the field.",1

So far as I know, Queens doesn't support any cpu_model_extra_flags besides pcid, so a cherry-pick -x would create documentation that contradicts the code 窶 unless I'm gravely misinformed. Can you clarify please?",0

Well, this section was omitted:

And doesn't mention anything about vmx, and since the cpu_model_extra_flags option is in queens couldn't we include that section?

It seems the vmx part you're talking about being omitted is this:

I'm trying to remember if there is another reason why we pegged pep8 at a certain version, but this dependency update and associated fixes look good to me",0
"Patch Set 1: Looks good to me (core reviewer); Approved

We had it pegged to prevent more restrictive pep8 rules from sneaking in. This is the right thing to do.",0

One non-blocking nit.
Can we just use

    list(pool.starmap(self._scrub_image, delete_jobs.items()))

We recently discussed the use of `six.iteritems` on the mailing list and came to the conclusion that dict.items() is fine. We don't need the performance cost of using six.iteritems.",1
"Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

After discussion at the meeting, we've decided that this change needs to be accompanied by configuration options. Please see the meeting minutes from today",1

Minor nit / question (same as nikhil's really).
IIRC, this is only called once in non-daemon mode. In daemon mode, it is called periodically. Does the config get reloaded every run so that in daemon mode it would get reloaded?

Assuming not, echoing Nikhil, why not just set in __init__?",1
"Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I'd like to see Nikhil and Jesse's concerns addressed + this rebased. This looks good otherwise. Thanks Hemanth.",1

Yes, it's called only once in non-daemon mode. And, in daemon mode, yes, it probably doesn't make sense to be doing this for every run.",0

Code looks ok, but you have a couple of issues with string whitespaces as far as I see. This would result in messed up help/log strings, and can be easily avoided IMO
tiny nit: you're missing trailing whitespace here and other lines.
While this is negligible 窶 let's not send malformed string for translation?
also why remove trailing whitespace here?",1

Code seems fine but there's neither a bug or a spec associated to this change. I think this is another case were a spec-lite model would be very helpful.

A question has come up about the doc impact.  This will affect the OpenStack Configuration Reference.  The relevant page is generated here:

https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals/blob/c0d4b3f222481854541743ae0eada1ae4396aec3/doc/config-reference/image-service/section_image-service-sample-configuration-files.xml#L49

So as long as we get our stable/liberty branch cut before the docs team generates the stable/liberty branch of the manuals, the change will get into the Liberty manuals.  Otherwise it will show up in the drafts branch.  So from the docs point of view, this change doesn't cause any extra work for them, it's up to us to get it merged in time if we want it to appear in the manual.",0

The commit message says ""XFS support for O_TMPFILE was only added in Linux 3.15""

Also, perhaps replace 'for' with 'when using'. At first read (possibly due to the incorrect version number) I thought 2.15+ referred to an xfs version)
delete first 'performance'
It's a little more than an efficiency gain...

Fixed a bug where container sync would not copy SLO manifests.

Fixed a bug where some tombstone files might never be reclaimed.",1

contrib.trove.api.trove looks too redundant because api.trove is under contrib.trove :-(

However, this minimizes the code change in this migration to contrib,
so I am okay with it now. More refactoring toward reasonable module patch is a future improvement.
It looks unrelated and I wonder why pep8 check does not complain... but I am okay with as-is.",1

Found a few nits and left a couple of suggestions for you.
Instead of checked here, maybe you should say ""True"" to stay consistent with the ""False"" on line 36 above.
Suggestion: Add the word ""fields"" after ""admin state"".
Suggestion: Change ""The"" to ""An"" to start the sentence.
Suggestion: Change the above to: ""The type of encryption algorithm...""
Missing space between '3600' and '(by default)'.

Also missing period at the end.
Suggestion: Change the above to: ""The name and description fields are optional, all others are required.""
Suggestion: Change ""The"" to ""An"" to start the sentence.
Suggestion: Change the above to: ""The type of encryption algorithm...""

Something is wrong somewhere between the NeutronClient and Horizon.

I can create IKEPolicy without any specifying any attributes in Horizon.
I cannot do that in NeutronClient( Bug in the Client maybe)
But it also means that not all the attributes you have mentioned as Necessary in the workflow is actually true.
Nit : Full stop at the end of the Statement
If the Lifetime has a default value, then why is it not optional ???

Edit:On the hindsight, I think we need to verify what are the actual values which are optional. Please see the standard output of the help file of neutron vpn-ikepolicy-create:


usage: neutron vpn-ikepolicy-create [-h]
                                    [--description DESCRIPTION]

                                    NAME

Seems Name is Required, others are optional.
Can you verify if the Lifetime attribute for IPSecPolicy also has a default value?
If yes, then maybe it is also optional??",1

@Shan

Your help text is quite clear. My suggestion was about the code itself. You could split the line another way (please see inline) and make the code more readable. It's not about what user will see, it's just about developer's convenience.
Please consider:

    admin_state_up = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=[(True, _('UP')), (False, _('DOWN'))],
        label=_(""Admin State""),
        help_text=_(""The state of VPN services to start in. ""
                    ""If DOWN (False), port does not forward packets.""),
        required=False)

Instead of five short lines of help text we get only two. It's much more readable and let us care less about whitespaces at the end of lines :)
Here we could do the same.",1

@Shan Guo, 
As per my initial discussion with Akihiro San, The Name attribute may be necessary in NeutronClient , but can be kept optional( for now ) in Horizon, to keep Backward compatibility.


But except the Name( Optional in Horizon, Necessary in NeutronClient) , the status of the other attributes should be changed. ( All attributes are Optional , in Horizon ,for the  IKEPolicy)",1

What is the subject of 'reference'? If it is 'the VPN service', it should be 'references to'.

An underscore is unnecessary in the help message. This is not a parameter.  ""Auth algorithm'
Why 'String'? lifetime consists of value and units. It looks odd.
the default value is 3600.
Needs a space before 5.
IPsec -> IPSec

In this form, 'IPSec' is used.

I think 'IPsec' is more widely used but it is not a scope of this patch.
Why 'checked'?

  The type of IPsec tunnel to be used.

The commit message says this change is introducing a dict transformation but now you've added entire extra class. The commit should be split in two
Since a later patch is storing this data in the database in JSON form, I'd like to see a docs comment against the to_dict methods that these are upgrade sensitive data formats.
I'd be inclined to have a separate 'VirtNUMAUsage' class, which accepted the VirtNUMACellUsage class, because I think it'll make it clearer in the code if we can document whether each parameter/return value is giving back usage data or not based on the object class accepted/returned.",1

It seems more natural for it to be an actual method as it uses values stored on the object... it would be possible to make it a classmethod (or even a staticmethod) as:

  @staticmethod

    ...
    data_dict['cpu_usage'] = numa_call.cpu_usage
    ...

for example, but it feels like an awkward API to me",0

Probably would be good to port the nova.virt.hardware classes into nova.objects at some point in the future -- as that would give us serialization, field type validation, and backend data storage for free.

The script is never tested by neutron UT or Tempest tests ... if the behavior of OVSBridge changes, no test will highlight it.

IMO, test_vxlan should in ovs_lib and tested.
Is it compliant with rootwrap-daemon-mode[1] ? Perhaps we should also allow script users to specify root_helper in the command line ?

[1] https://review.openstack.org/#/q/topic:bp/rootwrap-daemon-mode,n,z

I went back and forth on that very issue and went with the simplicity of having everything in one place and thinking that a test could easily be added to tempest to cover this. I can also see the benefit to just moving the whole thing to ovs_lib and using entry points. Or, like you mention just move the testing functions into ovs_lib, then document in this script that that is the proper place for them. I'm open to suggestion. :)
There's no reason I can think of that it shouldn't work with daemon mode. The default is 'sudo', so if no config file is passed in that's what it should be (actually, that isn't the case until I move the registering of the AGENT opts inside the conditional for config-file below...which I'll do). If root_helper is set up, this should be able to use it just like anything else.
I'm ok with this being done as a separate enhancement. I mostly interested in getting the design right for being able to implement these kinds of checks and for removing the runtime checks with this patch.

This has fixes for everything so far, except the possible move to ovs_lib. I added the ability to pass **kwargs through neutron.common.config.parse() so that I could avoid reading config files if --config-file wasn't passed. I could have just done cfg.CONF(project='neutron', version=..., default_config_files=[]), but duplicating the version stuff is ugly, and there is already another script (namespace_proxy) that manually calls cfg.CONF this way (but without specifying version info, so no --version), so it seems a useful use case.",0

nit: vxlan_supported is defined in BaseOVS and depends on OVSBridge which is a subclass of BaseOVS ... IMO, it seems more logic to define it in OVSBridge (as a class method) or even better as a module function.
OVSBridge create/destroy are not mocked ==> OVSBridge will really call ovs-vsctl ==>. tests will fail",1

Good stuff! a few nits inline.
the idea of having bin files was abandoned a while back, and functionality should be provided as entry points. See neutron-nsx-check for an example.
please, remove this script and install an entry point. At one time, the entire bin directory was dropped in favor of entry points. See pointer below. Also could I suggest a better name, i.e. neutron-sanity-checks perhaps?

Either way it kind of sucks.. If you look, OVSBase already depends on OVSBridge in a kind of silly way. And having vxlan_supported, which instantiates an OVSBridge itself, in OVSBridge isn't any cleaner. And this has to be in one of the two, otherwise testing becomes more of a pain because we need to have execute() mocked out.
Bah, I even tested this at one point, but in my own test class which mocked out execute() like OVS_Lib_Test, but w/o creating a bridge, etc. and then moved it thinking this class took care of it when it didn't. I'll move stuff around more. I repeat. Bah.
I'm not (yet!) convinced that entry points offer any benefit to this script and really just add more obfuscation. What is the benefit, here? Just convention? And if just convention, why do we have any bin/ scripts? Also, where would a script like this live in the tree? I don't see any place that looks like a particularly good place for something as general as this.",0

I am not sure where we'd go debating about this; there were good reasons when this decision was made back then, if you're interested I can try and find out the exact commit id :)

I agree with the other reviewers comments regarding the need to convert the script to an entry point, and otherwise have a couple of nits inline.
and test -> a test
I'd like to see this method moved to the check script on the basis of YAGNI.  I don't see any need to expose it in the ovs_lib api since it isn't  used anywhere else and should not be called at runtime.
Would it make sense to integrate this kind of error handling to add_tunnel_port() to ensure that failures to allocate vxlan ports could be logged as errors indicating that there may be a problem with vxlan support?",1

Thank you for refactoring the check out of ovs_lib, the current approach looks much better.  Some minor nits inline.
Please prefer a constant to a magic string.
Though you wouldn't know it from reviewing the existing codebase, ensuring the availability of configuration options by importing modules in this fashion is not good practice.  The way to explicitly accomplish the same thing is by using the import_opt/import_group methods of the config object, e.g.

https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/tests/unit/ml2/test_ml2_plugin.py#L39
I'm assuming you took this approach of modularity in response to comments from previous reviewers, but in future please avoid overcomplicating implementation until clear use cases present (YAGNI).
Prefer implicit boolean evaluation, e.g.

if not result:
   pass
Is there a reason not to extend BaseLinuxTestCase or refactor it for reuse, rather than duplicating things like check_sudo_enabled()?
As per pep8 (unfortunately no automatic check), please indent this line and the one previous by 4 spaces to differentiate from the block that follows.
Should this test be run as part of the unit test suite instead of the functional suite? test_ovs_vxlan_support_runs() validates system interaction, and would appear to already cover this method's validation of the bridge lifecycle.",1

Ah, handy. Thanks. I'll use import_group.
I'm not sure what approach to modularity this comment is referring to.
Done
Basically just because I didn't want to pollute this patch with more refactoring of other code. It starts to get hard to review after a while and it was such a very small thing that I needed, it just didn't seem worth it. Seemed like doing a refactor as a separate step later if there was more overlap would be the thing to do.
Done
It *could* be. I'd have to mock out some extra stuff like bridge creation/deletion, etc. It really isn't exactly a unit test and it isn't really exactly a functional test. I put it here mostly for the sake of simplicity/keeping related tests together. I'll go ahead and see about moving it.",0

"Patch Set 9:

(1 comment)
Honestly, after reading the code in the file, the TODO: would be something like ""rewrite all of this as an ovsdb client"". The entire premise of doing the get_port_ofport seems like a bad idea to me as it is used in things like add_port after running vsctl to create the port, then calling this to get the ofport by name afterward. This seems inherently race-condition prone to me since all kinds of things could happen between those calls.

The only reason I'm touching this function at all is because I was tired of seeing various versions of this try/except scattered around all over the place and I would have had to add another one when adding the vxlan add_tunnel_port error log message.

So I'm really not sure refactoring just the return value of this function really buys us anything. We aren't going to do math on the value, so whether it is a string or a number doesn't really matter.",0

this looks pretty good, extra cpu is a win

historically the queue was added as a response to some flailing trying to track down a memory leak of some kinda - some socket somewhere not getting closed correctly
dropping this interface also removes the only caller of _send_file
so this is where we were passing in the timeout value and error tracking handler before they got moved to the constructor",1

I'm pretty sure we can just get id of the put_queue_depth option now, doesn't even need a deprecation period.
We could get rid of this over in swift/proxy/server.py now, and remove it from the sample proxy-server.conf.
So this wait seems maybe significant -- is there any extra value to making sure we've sent all the chunks before waiting on the responses? I guess maybe no... I suppose we ought to wait for the other side either way? And it's on the operating system to get the send buffer out as it can.

I just worry a little about something like a deadlock, where the proxy hasn't finished sending 'cause it's got some data waiting in buffer, but it's stuck waiting for a response from an object server that hasn't gotten all of its data... but it really shouldn't be our problem and you make a convincing case in the commit message.

Worst case, I suppose there are Timeouts still just in case...",1

It was waiting for the queue to be empty, meaning that all chunks were moved to the socket buffer. Now that we directly  write to the socket, we get the same guarantee.

Love it, nice work Romain!

Just a doc string NIT (sorry, but one of the doc strings has gone so far to include params, so this should be kept up to date).

And if I get some time I'd like to run some basic benchmarks just to be thorough seeing as this is inline to object PUTs.

No problem, thx for pointing it.

Make sure to not be limited by the object-server during your bench. Still, you should at least see the jiffies improvement.

It's not really user-level functionality -- the general scheme in Cinder is to define details like that in a volume type configured by the admin.

This is a neat change can do a lot for front-end capacity-based QoS. A few suggestions:
1) keywords like 'write_iops_sec_per_gb' is actually the interface to make this work, can we somehow make it easier (besides put this into Cinder doc) for admins/devs to use?

In general, it looks good to me. 

Please remove the SECRET_KEY generation stuff from local_settings.py.example, too.

I'd also expect, apache (or any other webserver process) is not able to write to the specified file, IMHO we should prevent the web server from having write access to the directory containing source code at all.

What about writing to '/tmp'?",1

Matthias: I see your point(s), however I don't think the proper decisions are obvious. I actually left the local_settings.py.example bit on purpose because I think people should be made as aware of SECRET_KEY as possible, and writing to /tmp has both pros and cons. I'd like to revisit this as a ticket in RC1 and go ahead with the merge to fix this for the H3 cut. I've filed https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1220884 to track.",0

Ima fix the typo right quick, then I'll be +2.
This approach also has the advantage of allowing :ref:s from other documents, and allows us to change the titles themselves without breaking links that use those references. From the sphinx docs [1]:

""Using ref is advised over standard reStructuredText links to sections (like `Section title`_) because it works across files, when section headings are changed, will raise warnings if incorrect, and works for all builders that support cross-references.""

Good change, looks good all-in-all.  I have a comment on the wording of your help text.  Fix if you need to resubmit.
This wording is a little confusing.  If you resubmit I would change this:

Just a question inline.
Should there be a timeout in between mount requests?  I am not sure if attempting a mount one after the other would fix the true issue.",0
"Patch Set 1:

Some responses to review comments.
It's a good suggestion.  I will wait and see if there other reasons to resubmit as you suggest.
I thought we might need this too, but in testing (hundreds of iterations) without  it we didn't need it.  What happens is that on the very first retry after a contention situation (backup driver and volume driver are contending) the driver that failed the mount finds that the mount has succeeded (the other guy did it) so that the re-mount isn't even attempted.

Down the road I suppose there might be another kind of contention where a timeout would be appropriate, but my thinking is that at this point that's hypothetical and I don't want to add code to deal with a situation that I really don't know and understand yet while fixing a known, concrete issue.

These lines are all too long

You can remove these two lines
_iterate_and _find() will only return a single entry, so this can be simplified.

I am not sure this change actually changes a lot in terms of performance.
It might still be acceptable, but I would consider opening a new bug report for it and merging the change once icehouse is release.

As there are logic changes which might need comprehensive testing I reckon it's better to defer this patch.

I won't give -1 because I don't see anything really wrong with the patch.
Won't the same optimization be achieved by wrapping old_filter and new_filter with reversed() and taking the first entry below instead of the last.  It would be a much easier change to review and less risk.  Just a thought.

Added response to a couple of carl's comments
Thanks for reviewing Carl.
No , that wouldnt be the same. The whole point of moving out of list comprehensions is to stop iteration as soon as we find the required element. reversing the list is required to fetch the latest entry in the list. 
I verified the time it takes to search a huge list (with more than 40k entries) in both approaches and list comprehensions take significantly more time than the proposed new approach.
Same response as above.",0

Right, I fell in to the trap of thinking that a list comprehension is implemented like a generator and doesn't actually create a list.  I stand corrected.",0

Reply for Mark's comments inline.
Thanks for the comments Mark. 
in the elif loop we have another statement of decrementing the ruls_index.
Also we have an else condition which assigns different value for rule_str. 

So making the suggested change will result in additional changes. 
Correct??",0

I'm not sure the resultant code with this change is any more readable, and it only removes one line:

    if old or dup:
        rule_str = str(old or dup)
        # backup one index so we write the array correctly
        if not old:
            rules_index -= 1

We can't use ""if dup"" since it might not be assigned.

I guess I can move ""rules_index -= 1"" up to line 496+ but it also only saves one line of code.",0

Why are things failing so much on this patch?
I don't see anything encouraging the use of copyright.  I see this in both of your links:  ""Generally speaking, copyright notices are no longer required in order to create or protect your copyright rights, but they may nonetheless be useful""  This doesn't sound to me like it is encouraging the use of copyrights and it certainly is not a requirement to include them.  It merely acknowledges the fact that some people might want to use them and that's okay.

I find them to be totally pointless.  Most files in our repository contain contributions from many companies.  I think that is great and I think it is misleading for any one of these files to contain a copyright statement for one single company.

I intend to leave out the copyright statement.  I don't feel it is appropriate to -1 for leaving it out but you're always entitled to your opinion.  Just keep in mind that it may cause other reviewers to skip reviewing my patch because of it.",0

I understand your intention but other neutron developers always has added it into new file. I'd like to know the policy in Neutron so that we get the consistent code. At least I haven't seen new file without copyright.

However, I don't want to disturb you since this patch itself is really good for me so I will remove -1.",1

This doesn't look reasonable to me at *all* - but I don't understand how painful the bug is either... do you think 1s would be enough?
5 seconds is a lot... I mean if a unittest is getting anywhere near this it *should* fail?  The default is 500ms - so this is 10x what we need in production on *real* networks!?

I don't know what number is sufficient to cope with any CI. Yes I would be happy with 1s - if anyone still sees it fail we can always bump it higher.

Thanks for the bug report :) So IIUC we won't need to compile OVS for functional job after all. And we need kernel module to make local VxLAN working anyway.
Shouldn't be there something like ""head -n1"" ?
What is this var?
I suggest to separate it now to a new function:

Not sure we want to tests different 'project_id' or different 'string' in policy rule.

If first then this is duplicate tests with what we have in test_server_start_stop.py. Anyways I am checking this with Alex and cleaned up later if needed.

Minor thing inline, but otherwise looks good. Thanks.
I believe this needs to be wrapped in a (_(""string"")) in order to ensure it gets marked for translation. Also I think Ironic should be capitalized (at least it was in the previous message).",1

Thanks Clif for the patch.

No major issues, just some cleanup in the way we're logging.

I'm half thinking that we should turn ClientWrapper into a singleton rather than relying upon the invocation model used by the nova.virt.ironic.driver to ensure that only one copy of the ClientWrapper exists - but this would be at the cost of greater complexity.  If a new copy of ClientWrapper were instantiated, the only hurt would be performance, so I'm not recommending this path.

To get code review on this, you should go to a Nova weekly meeting and represent your case as to why this should get reviewed.  If you are proactive, you are much more likely to get eyeballs on the patch.
This should be a ""Note(clif_h):""
Don't do the _() translation here, as the log level to use is potentially variable at this point.
I don't really like this construct, I think it's better to LOG.warn(_LW(...)) here rather than do a ""+ msg"" and log later on.  We should dynamically build up log strings (unless it's just variable substitution) because it makes life harder for translators.

Thanks for the review! I addressed some of your concerns, and replied to others. Please take a look at your convenience.

I've read through the guidelines (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.i18n/guidelines.html), and it appears as though _() is the proper construct to use if the message is to go anywhere outside of the logs. The variance of the log level doesn't matter since the message can escape this context as an exception.

Thanks for the extra tests Clif.

Since you're going to have to upload a new version due to test failures, please consider my suggestion for simplifying one of your newly added tests.  Thanks.
While this test works, it's more complex than it needs to be.  You could simplify this as:

@mock.patch.object(ironic_client, 'get_client')
def test_call_uses_cached_client(self, mock_get_client):
    ironicclient = client_wrapper.IronicClientWrapper()
    ironicclient.call(""node.list"")
    ironicclient.call(""node.list"")
    ironicclient.call(""node.list"")
    self.assertEqual(1, mock_get_client.call_count)

...and achieve the same result.",1

LGTM overall. :)

A nice thing to do (if you push another patch, or as a follow-on patch) would be to stop passing self.ironicclient to _wait_for_active, _unprovision, etc., since you can just access the client object there.
Nit if you push another patch, there's a trailing space in this log message.",1

Mainly curious about what looks like duplication in test_driver.py.
Is this not already handled on line 79?
Also, I'm not sure I would classify this as a warning.  This is going to happen under normal operation right?  I would log it at a debug level.
Why not remove the ironicclient argument to this method?",1
"Patch Set 9:

(2 comments)

I think I'm still fine with this as is, left some more comments.
The patch on line 79 patches when each test function is executed, which happens after setUp() is called. It now needs to be patched when line 91 is run.

I wonder if we could remove 79, but then we would need to get a reference to it here and tie it to self. That might be more optimal, I'm not sure.
Agreed, if you push another patch, should just go ahead and do it.",1

It's not clear to me what below might access cw.IronicClientWrapper behind the scenes, but only a few tests seem to use it directly.  I would recommend removing line 79, storing it here on the object, and then cleaning up after each test.  It doesn't seem likely to cause issues but could be a source of frustration for someone down the road when some state isn't what they expect it to be.",1

(4 comments)
The IronicDriver utilizes IronicClientWrapper behind the scenes. Based on my limited understanding of the mock module the '@mock.patch.object' class decorator will patch cw at the beginning of each class method with the 'test_' prefix. That was fine when the wrapper was constructed for each ironic call. However, I've modified IronicDriver to only construct the wrapper once during IronicDriver.__init__. Therefore the setup method needs to be mock patched instead of the class. This should produce the correct behavior and obviate the need for any cleanup in a tearDown() method.
Done
That seems reasonable. Downgrading to debug.
While normally I would agree, _validate_instance_and_node is not a class method, but a stand-alone function defined at driver.py's top-level.

If this should be pursued, I feel as though it should be its own change.",0
