You need at least os-brick 1.11.0 for these changes, but we require 1.8.0 at a minimum today:

https://github.com/openstack/requirements/blob/master/global-requirements.txt#L150

So you need to bump global-requirements for a new minimum (1.11.0 at this point).",1

We also need to get gate-tempest-dsvm-neutron-scenario-multinode-ubuntu-xenial-nv running in the nova check queue (or experimental queue) and run this patch through that, since that's where the encrypted volume tests run now.
nit: I believe this is redundant, the old encryptor base code in nova didn't pass in CONF:

"Patch Set 1:

Thank you for your first contribution to OpenStack.

    Your patch will now be tested automatically by OpenStack testing frameworks
    and once the automatic tests pass, it will be reviewed by other friendly
    developers. They will give you feedback and may require you to refine it.

    People seldom get their patch approved on the first try, so don't be
    concerned if requested to make corrections. Feel free to modify your patch
    and resubmit a new change-set.

    Patches usually take 3 to 7 days to be reviewed so be patient and be
    available on IRC to ask and answer questions about your work. The more you
    participate in the community the more rewarding it is for you. You may also
    notice that the more you get to know people and get to be known, the faster
    your patches will be reviewed and eventually approved. Get to know others
    and become known by doing code reviews: anybody can do it, and it's a
    great way to learn the code base.

    Thanks again for supporting OpenStack, we look forward to working with you.

I believe this is intended to read something like:

    Removing logical units should be done before attempting to delete the target,
